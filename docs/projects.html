<h2>Tock</h2>
<p>Embedded operating systems have traditionally been limited to
libraries that abstract hardware and implement common utilities. These
systems provide only limited mechanisms, if any, to ensure the safety
of drivers and isolate applications. Instead, developers must assume
that all code is equally trustworthy and bug free.</p>
<p>Tock is a safe, multitasking operating system for memory
constrained devices. It is written in Rust, a type-safe systems language
which is used to enforce safety of of kernel components. Tock allows
applications, which can be written in any language, to be compiled and loaded
independently from the kernel.</p>

<p>A workshop paper on our experiences building an embedded operating system in
Rust was published at PLOS'15.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
Rust, a new systems programming language, provides compile-time memory safety
checks to help eliminate runtime bugs that manifest from improper memory
management. This feature is advantageous for operating system development, and
especially for embedded OS development, where recovery and debugging are
particularly challenging. However, embedded platforms are highly event-based,
and Rust’s memory safety mechanisms largely presume threads. In our experience
developing an operating system for embedded systems in Rust, we have found that
Rust’s ownership model prevents otherwise safe resource sharing common in the
embedded domain, conflicts with the reality of hardware resources, and hinders
using closures for programming asynchronously. We describe these experiences
and how they relate to memory safety as well as illustrate our workarounds that
preserve the safety guarantees to the largest extent possible. In addition, we
draw from our experience to propose a new language extension to Rust that would
enable it to provide better memory safety tools for event-driven platforms.</p>

<h2>PowerBlade</h2>
<p>With an increasing number of miscellaneous electrical loads used in residential
and commercial buildings, understanding electricity usage patterns requires
metering every load. Existing plug-load power meters are bulky, power-hungry,
and require manual user interaction to record energy use. PowerBlade is a new
take on power meter designs that has an essentially 2D form factor. Loads
literally plug-through it and into the outlet. This means PowerBlade can stay
attached to the load plug itself, truly monitoring an individual device, rather
than an outlet. Designing a functional power meter with extreme volume
constraints requires rethinking the traditional power meter design choices.
PowerBlade employs a simplified AC power supply design, a novel method for
noninvasively sensing current draw, and a Bluetooth Low-Energy radio to
transmit data to nearby smartphones. This work was published and demonstrated
at SenSys 2015.</p>

</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
We present PowerBlade, the smallest, lowest cost, and lowest
power AC plug-load meter that measures real, reactive and apparent power, and
reports this data, along with cumulative energy consumption, over an
industry-standard Bluetooth Low Energy radio. Achieving this design point
requires revisiting every aspect of conventional power meters: a new method of
acquiring voltage; a non-invasive, planar method of current measurement; an
efficient and accurate method of computing power from the voltage and current
channels; a radio interface that leverages nearby smart phones to display data
and report it to the cloud; and a retro power supply re-imagined with vastly
lower current draw, allowing extreme miniaturization. PowerBlade occupies a
mere 1" × 1" footprint, offers a 1/16" profile, draws less than 180 mW itself,
offers 1.13% error on unity power factor loads in the 2-1200 W range and
slightly worse for non-linear and reactive loads, and costs $11 in modest
quantities of about 1,000 units. This new design point enables affordable
large-scale studies of plug-load energy usage—an area of growing national
importance.</p>

<h2>Wearabouts</h2>
<p><strong>"Who's in lab?"</strong></p>
<p>This is a harder question to answer than it may seem. Determining the location of
individuals indoors remains an unsolved problem.</p>
<p>The goal of Wearabouts is to perform room-level localization of individuals.
The expected output would include each discovered individual and
which room they have been found in.
An important piece of the design is to not require individuals to carry any
extra devices. We want to use only things they already carry and
characteristics of who they are to discover them. Currently, the system uses
Bluetooth Low-Energy advertisements from devices like
<a href="https://www.fitbit.com/">Fitbits</a> to discover people and adds information from
RFID door entry and smartphone WiFi connections to increase its accuracy.</p>

<h2>Thermes</h2>
<p>Taking the Monjolo Principle of energy-harvester as a sensor, we created a new
platform with a heat harvesting thermoelectric generator. This work was
published at ENSsys 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
Fine-grained energy metering in homes and buildings provides a promising
technique for addressing the unmaintainable energy consumption levels of
worldwide buildings. Metering electricity, lighting, natural gas, HVAC,
occupancy, and water on a per appliance or room basis can provide invaluable insight
when trying to reduce a building's energy footprint. A myriad of sensor designs
and systems collect data on particular building aspects, but are often hampered
by installation difficulty or ongoing maintenance needs (like battery
replacement). We address these common pitfalls for water and heat metering by
developing a small, energy-harvesting sensor that meters using the same
thermoelectric generator with which it powers itself. In short, the rate at which
the harvester captures energy is proportional to the heat production of the
monitored appliance or pipe and this relationship allows us to estimate energy use
simply based on the sensor's ability to harvest. We prototype our sensor in a
bracelet shaped form-factor that can attach to a shower head pipe, faucet, or
appliance to provide local hot water or heat metering.</p>

<h2>Green Lights Forever</h2>
<p>Starting as a course project in
<a href="https://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs588/">EECS 588</a>, a group of three other
students and I investigated the security of an intelligent traffic light system
in the United States. This work was published at WOOT 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
The safety critical nature of traffic infrastructure requires that it
be secure against computer-based attacks, but this is not always the case.
We investigate a networked traffic signal system currently deployed in the
United States and discover a number of security flaws that exist due to
systemic failures by the designers. We leverage these flaws to create attacks
which gain control of the system, and we successfully demonstrate them on the
deployment in coordination with authorities. Our attacks show that an
adversary can control traffic infrastructure to cause disruption, degrade
safety, or gain an unfair advantage. We make recommendations on how to improve
existing systems and discuss the lessons learned for embedded systems security
in general.</p>

<h2>NSF Fellowship</h2>
<p>In my 2013 I applied to the NSF Graduate Research
Fellowship Program and was lucky enough to be awarded a fellowship. This was
the first year with the new essay rules that reduce the application to two
essays, Background &amp; Previous Research and Proposed Research, a total of five
pages. Below, I have provided my essays as well as the reviews I received as
examples for other students applying to the program.</p>

<h2>SensEye</h2>
<p>The eyes are the window to the soul. What could a computer do if it knew what
you were looking at?</p>
<p>SensEye is an attempt to start answering that question. Low-power real-time
gaze detection is finally within our grasp. Using a microcontroller running
uCLinux and an FPGA, we can pull real-time images from two small cameras, one
facing inwards towards the eye and one facing outwards towards the world. This
data can be used to determine which object in view you are observing. Imagine
a world where your car would warn you if you were not paying attention, where
your phone would have interesting information available on the item you were
just observing, and where you could track how you actually spend your time each
day.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this goal, our system has to be both energy efficient and 
low cost. We hope to create such a system and distribute it to software
developers in order to spur innovation.</p>

<h2>Oculus-ASR</h2>
<p>During my undergraduate studies at Michigan Tech I was part of the
<a href="http://www.aerospace.mtu.edu/">Aerospace Enterprise</a>, a group of students 
building a nanosatellite as part of the University Nanosatellite Program. We
won the 6th iteration of the competition and have been finalizing flight
hardware. The mission is set to launch using the Falcon Heavy on mission STP-2.</p>
<p>The purpose of the satellite is to help test United States' space situational
awareness capabilities. Using spectroscopy, the attitude and configuration of
a satellite can be determined if it is first characterized on the ground.
Oculus-ASR has been characterized and has the ability to control and observe
its orientation and configuration. The Air Force will use our satellite to 
calibrate their algorithms and enable new advances in space awareness.</p>
