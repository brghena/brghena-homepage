### 2nd International Workshop on Energy Neutral Sensing Systems
At ENSsys I presented the work on Thermes, our thermoelectric energy-harvesting
water meter. The presentation looked at Thermes as a member of the Monjolo
family and the challenges that make thermoelectric energy harvesting unique.

### JPL Cubesat Symposium
The Cubesat Symposium is a yearly event at JPL where students and full-time
employees have the chance to describe their current projects in small
satellites. I gave a short presentation on the Oculus-ASR satellite which I
worked on during my undergrad at Michigan Tech.
