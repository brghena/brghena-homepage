### 5th International Workshop on Energy Harvesting and Energy-Neutral Sensing Systems
At ENSsys I presented our workshop paper on multi-tenant energy-harvesting
systems, and the abstractions necessary to enable them. The primary requirement
is isolation, which can allow systems to sanely budget their own energy
allocation without having to account for the usage of other applications. The
talk included a discussion with members of the community about what challenges
future multi-tenant systems will face, and what directions future community
research should go.

### 2nd International Workshop on Energy Neutral Sensing Systems
At ENSsys I presented the work on Thermes, our thermoelectric energy-harvesting
water meter. The presentation looked at Thermes as a member of the Monjolo
family and the challenges that make thermoelectric energy harvesting unique.

### 8th USENIX Workshop on Offensive Technologies
At WOOT I presented on the Green Lights Forever paper which was accepted at
the workshop. The presentation was an overview of our work investigating the
security of intelligent traffic light systems.

### JPL Cubesat Symposium
The Cubesat Symposium is a yearly event at JPL where students and full-time
employees have the chance to describe their current projects in small
satellites. I gave a short presentation on the Oculus-ASR satellite which I
worked on during my undergrad at Michigan Tech.
