I filled in as a guest lecturer for two sessions of EECS 373: Design of
Microproccessor-Based Systems. I taught on embedded systems toolchains, ARM
Application Binary Interface, Memory-Mapped I/O, and the AMBA Advanced
Peripheral Bus. The lectures can be found on the
[class website](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~prabal/teaching/eecs373/) and
example code is available on
[my github](https://github.com/brghena/eecs373_toolchain_examples).

I was a Graduate Student Instructor for EECS 370: Computer Organization. My job
included teaching discussion sessions, holding office hours, and grading
homework. I discovered that teaching is both a considerable amount of work and
something I really enjoy.

I won an Outstanding GSI Award for my efforts in EECS 370.
