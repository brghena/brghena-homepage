Teaching
========

I love teaching. I've always taken to mentorship positions, even in undergrad
and high school. Since becomming a grad student, I've had the priveledge to be
involved as a teacher in several classes and have enjoyed doing so immensely.
My goal as an instructor is to connect students to the real-world, practical
experience of engineering.

TA - Introduction to Embedded Systems:
--------------------------------------

In Fall 2018, I was a graduate student instructor for EE149: Introduction to
Embedded Systems at UC Berkeley. I was one of three TAs in charge of all lab
and project work for the course. The course covers many aspects of the design
and analysis of cyber-physical systems including sensors, system dynamics,
wireless networking, state machines, memory management, and embedded operating
systems. The course includes an eight-week project where teams of 3-4 students
work on a system of their own choosing that demonstrates the cyber-physical
systems concepts they've learned in the course. Projects from Fall 2018
included gloves that played musical notes as you moved the fingers, Kinect
motion controls for coordinating swarms of robots, and tracking interactions
with a steering wheel to display accurate information in a virtual reality
headset. I won an Outstanding GSI Award from UC Berkeley for my work in the
course.

For this semester, we redesigned all of the labs from scratch to focus on
command line embedded tools (GCC cross compiling, Make, and JTAG code upload)
based on a development board that I designed, the [Berkeley
Buckler](https://github.com/lab11/buckler). Buckler is a shield for the nRF52
development kit and gives students access to various sensors and an LCD
display, and is also connectable to the Kobuki robot platform. The redesigned
labs covered topics including: embedded development tools, interfacing with
sensors, memory mapped I/O peripherals, interrupts, virtualized timers, and
controlling robots with state machines.

TA - Computer Organization:
---------------------------

In Fall 2013, I was a graduate student instructor for EECS 370: Computer
Organization at the University of Michigan. The course covers basic processor
design (up to multi-stage pipelines), assembly language, and memory management.
My job included teaching discussion sessions, holding office hours, and grading
homework. I discovered that teaching is both a considerable amount of work and
something I really enjoy. I won an Outstanding GSI Award for my efforts in EECS
370. Below are the discussion lecture slides that I created.

Undergraduate Research:
-----------------------

At Michigan and at Berkeley I was proud to support undergraduate research. At
Michigan I advised seven undergraduates and two high school students for
positions either during the summer or the school year. Four of these students
have since gone on to pursue PhDs in computer science. At UC Berkeley, six
students from the Introduction to Embedded Systems class were inspired to
pursue research with our lab group after the course ended.

Embedded Systems Office Hours:
------------------------------

The [Michigan Embedded Systems Hub](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/hub/) (MESH) is
an open lab providing power supplies, oscillscopes, and soldering supplies to
allow students to design, fabricate, and test real hardware systems. MESH
frequently holds classes on soldering and PCB design and enables many student
groups to tackle ambitious hardware design projects. MESH also holds office
hours on embedded systems topics, open to anyone at the university.

From 2014 to 2017 I held these office hours weekly during semesters. I advised
individual students taking project-based classes, student groups working on
projects, and researchers in other departments. As an example, during one
office hour session, I spoke with a group working on a drive-by-wire tractor
about how to power their system, helped design a PCB with a student
remote-controlling a cockroach, and debugged software with a neurscience
researcher working on eye monitoring hardware. The idea of holding open office
hours for the entire university is one that I hope to start at other
institutions in the future.

Guest Lectures:
---------------

**Introduction to Embedded Systems**

At Berkeley, I sometimes covered lectures in the intro to embedded systems
class: EE149. My lectures have covered networking and memory architecture
topics.

**Design of Microprocessor-Based Systems**

At Michigan, I occasionally filled in as a guest lecturer for EECS 373: Design
of Microprocessor-Based Systems. I have taught on embedded systems toochains,
ARM Application Binary Interface, Memory-Mapped I/O, and the AMBA Advanced
Peripheral Bus. Example code from class is available on [my
github](https://github.com/brghena/eecs373_toolchain_examples).
