Teaching

I was a Graduate Student Instructor for EECS 370: Computer Organization. My job
included teaching discussion sessions, holding office hours, and grading
homework. I discovered that teaching is both a considerable amount of work and
something I really enjoy.

I won an Outstanding GSI Award for my efforts in EECS 370.
