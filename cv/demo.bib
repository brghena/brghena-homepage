    abstract = {The gateway is a key component for sensor network deployments
        and the Internet of Things. Sensor deployments often tend towards
        low-power communication protocols such as Bluetooth Low Energy or IEEE
        802.15.4. Gateways are essential to connect these devices to the
        Internet at large. Over time though, gateways have gained additional
        responsibilities as well. Sensors expect gateways to handle
        device-specific data translation and local processing while also
        providing services, such as time synchronization, to the low-power
        device. As a centralized computing resource, the gateway is also an
        obvious location for running local applications which interact with
        sensor data and control nearby actuators. Today, vendors and
        researchers often create their own device-specific gateways to handle
        these responsibilities.

        We propose a generic gateway platform capable of supporting the needs
        of many devices. In our architecture, devices provide a pointer, such
        as a URL, to descriptions of their interfaces. The gateway can download
        the interface descriptions and use them to determine how to interact
        with the device, translating its data to a usable format and enabling
        local services to communicate with it. The translated data is provided
        to services including user applications, local logging, device status
        monitoring, and cloud applications. By simultaneously supporting
        communication with many sensors, our gateway architecture can simplify
        future sensor network deployments and enable intelligent building
        applications.

    abstract = { The era of city-scale sensing is dawning. Supported by new
        sensing capabilities, the capability to detect and measure phenomena
        throughout a large area will allow deeper insight and understanding
        into how cities work. The challenge of city-scale sensing is not
        limited to developing new sensing applications, however. A sensor must
        be installed in a location. It must be provided power, storage, and
        communications. All these tasks stand aside from the desired sensing
        effort, but are necessary nevertheless.

        In this demo, we introduce an initial prototype for a modular,
        city-scale sensing platform---the signpost network. The platform,
        designed to be physically attached to sign posts throughout a city,
        reduces the burden for sensor and application developers by providing
        the necessary resources to modules attached to it. Power is provided by
        harvesting from solar panels with battery storage, with each module
        allocated a certain subset of the system energy. The signpost platform
        also provides data storage, long-range communication, data processing,
        module isolation, and an installation point for connected modules. The
        signpost acts as a modular base station for researchers, citizen
        scientists, and other interested parties to deploy custom sensors for
        applications such as pedestrian counting, air quality monitoring, and
        RF spectrum sensing at a city-wide scale.

    abstract = { We present PowerBlade, the smallest and lowest power AC plug-load
        meter that measures real, reactive and apparent power, and reports this
        data, along with cumulative energy consumption, over an
        industry-standard Bluetooth Low Energy radio. Achieving this design
        point requires revisiting every aspect of conventional power meters: a
        new method of acquiring voltage; a non-invasive, planar method of
        current measurement; an efficient and accurate method of computing
        power from the voltage and current channels; a radio interface that
        leverages nearby smart phones to display data and report it to the
        cloud; and a retro power supply reimagined with vastly lower current
        draw, allowing extreme miniaturization. PowerBlade occupies a mere 1" by 1"
        footprint, offers a 1/16" profile, draws 52~mW continuously,
        offers 1.13\% error on unity power factor loads in the 2-1200~W range
        and slightly worse for non-linear and reactive loads, and costs \$11 in
        modest quantities of about 1000 units. This new design point enables
        affordable large-scale studies of plug-load energy usage---an area of
        growing national importance.
