    abstract = { We present PowerBlade, the smallest and lowest power AC plug-load
        meter that measures real, reactive and apparent power, and reports this
        data, along with cumulative energy consumption, over an
        industry-standard Bluetooth Low Energy radio. Achieving this design
        point requires revisiting every aspect of conventional power meters: a
        new method of acquiring voltage; a non-invasive, planar method of
        current measurement; an efficient and accurate method of computing
        power from the voltage and current channels; a radio interface that
        leverages nearby smart phones to display data and report it to the
        cloud; and a retro power supply reimagined with vastly lower current
        draw, allowing extreme miniaturization. PowerBlade occupies a mere 1" by 1"
        footprint, offers a 1/16" profile, draws 52~mW continuously,
        offers 1.13\% error on unity power factor loads in the 2-1200~W range
        and slightly worse for non-linear and reactive loads, and costs \$11 in
        modest quantities of about 1000 units. This new design point enables
        affordable large-scale studies of plug-load energy usage---an area of
        growing national importance.
