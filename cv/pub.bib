    abstract = { We present PowerBlade, the smallest, lowest cost, and lowest power
        AC plug-load meter that measures real, reactive and apparent power, and
        reports this data, along with cumulative energy consumption, over an
        industry-standard Bluetooth Low Energy radio.  Achieving this design
        point requires revisiting every aspect of conventional power meters: a
        new method of acquiring voltage; a non-invasive, planar method of
        current measurement; an efficient and accurate method of computing
        power from the voltage and current channels; a radio interface that
        leverages nearby smart phones to display data and report it to the
        cloud; and a retro power supply re-imagined with vastly lower current
        draw, allowing extreme miniaturization.  PowerBlade occupies a mere 1"
        $\times$ 1" footprint, offers a 1/16" profile, draws less
        than 180~mW itself, offers 1.13\% error on unity power factor loads in
        the 2-1200~W range and slightly worse for non-linear and reactive
        loads, and costs \$11 in modest quantities of about 1,000 units.  This
        new design point enables affordable large-scale studies of plug-load
        energy usage---an area of growing national importance.

    abstract = { Rust, a new systems programming language, provides
        compile-time memory safety checks to help eliminate runtime bugs that
        manifest from improper memory management. This feature is advantageous
        for operating system development, and especially for embedded OS
        development, where recovery and debugging are particularly challenging.
        However, embedded platforms are highly event-based, and Rust's memory
        safety mechanisms largely presume threads. In our experience developing
        an operating system for embedded systems in Rust, we have found that
        Rust's {\em ownership} model prevents otherwise safe resource sharing
        common in the embedded domain, conflicts with the reality of hardware
        resources, and hinders using closures for programming asynchronously.
        We describe these experiences and how they relate to memory safety as
        well as illustrate our workarounds that preserve the safety guarantees
        to the largest extent possible. In addition, we draw from our
        experience to propose a new language extension to Rust that would
        enable it to provide better memory safety tools for event-driven
        platforms.

    abstract = {Fine-grained energy metering in homes and buildings provides a promising
    technique for addressing the unmaintainable energy consumption levels of
    worldwide buildings. Metering electricity, lighting, natural gas, HVAC,
    occupancy, and water on a per appliance or room basis can provide invaluable insight
    when trying to reduce a building's energy footprint. A myriad of sensor designs
    and systems collect data on particular building aspects, but are often hampered
    by installation difficulty or ongoing maintenance needs (like battery
    replacement). We address these common pitfalls for water and heat metering by
    developing a small, energy-harvesting sensor that meters using the same
    thermoelectric generator with which it powers itself. In short, the rate at which
    the harvester captures energy is proportional to the heat production of the
    monitored appliance or pipe and this relationship allows us to estimate energy use
    simply based on the sensor's ability to harvest. We prototype our sensor in a
    bracelet shaped form-factor that can attach to a shower head pipe, faucet, or
    appliance to provide local hot water or heat metering.},

    systemic failures by the designers. We leverage these flaws to create attacks
    which gain control of the system, and we successfully demonstrate them on the

    adversary can control traffic infrastructure to cause disruption, degrade
