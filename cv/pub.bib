    abstract = {Fine-grained energy metering in homes and buildings provides a promising
    technique for addressing the unmaintainable energy consumption levels of
    worldwide buildings. Metering electricity, lighting, natural gas, HVAC,
    occupancy, and water on a per appliance or room basis can provide invaluable insight
    when trying to reduce a building's energy footprint. A myriad of sensor designs
    and systems collect data on particular building aspects, but are often hampered
    by installation difficulty or ongoing maintenance needs (like battery
    replacement). We address these common pitfalls for water and heat metering by
    developing a small, energy-harvesting sensor that meters using the same
    thermoelectric generator with which it powers itself. In short, the rate at which
    the harvester captures energy is proportional to the heat production of the
    monitored appliance or pipe and this relationship allows us to estimate energy use
    simply based on the sensor's ability to harvest. We prototype our sensor in a
    bracelet shaped form-factor that can attach to a shower head pipe, faucet, or
    appliance to provide local hot water or heat metering.},

    abstract = {The safety critical nature of traffic infrastructure requires that it
    be secure against computer-based attacks, but this is not always the case.
    We investigate a networked traffic signal system currently deployed in the
    United States and discover a number of security flaws that exist due to
    systemic failures by the designers. We leverage these flaws to create attacks
    which gain control of the system, and we successfully demonstrate them on the
    deployment in coordination with authorities. Our attacks show that an
    adversary can control traffic infrastructure to cause disruption, degrade
    safety, or gain an unfair advantage. We make recommendations on how to improve
    existing systems and discuss the lessons learned for embedded systems security
    in general.},
