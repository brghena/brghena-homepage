    abstract = {The safety critical nature of traffic infrastructure requires that it
    be secure against computer-based attacks, but this is not always the case.
    We investigate a networked traffic signal system currently deployed in the
    United States and discover a number of security flaws that exist due to
    systemic failures by the designers. We leverage these flaws to create attacks
    which gain control of the system, and we successfully demonstrate them on the
    deployment in coordination with authorities. Our attacks show that an
    adversary can control traffic infrastructure to cause disruption, degrade
    safety, or gain an unfair advantage. We make recommendations on how to improve
    existing systems and discuss the lessons learned for embedded systems security
    in general.},
